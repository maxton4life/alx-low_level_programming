The C Preprocessor is not a part of the compiler, but is a separate step in the compilation process. 

In simple terms, a C Preprocessor is just a text substitution tooland it instructs the compiler to do required pre-processing beforethe actual compilation.

All processor commands begin with the hash# symbol.

THIS IS A PROJECT FROM ALX ON C PREPROCESSOR.
